# Archived State Tracking Files

This directory contains historical state tracking files from the previous documentation methodology.

**Archived on**: 2025-11-12

**Reason**: Consolidated into single `STATE.md` file at project root for better context engineering and reduced cognitive load.

## Archived Files

- **goals.md** - Feature goals and success criteria
- **progress.md** - Phase tracking and completion status  
- **learnings.md** - Key insights and decisions
- **implementation_plan.md** - Step-by-step development plan
- **testing_plan.md** - Test strategy and test plans
- **assumptions_and_risks.md** - Risk assessment

## New Methodology

**See**: `STATE.md` (project root) for current state tracking

**Benefits of new approach**:
- Single source of truth for project state
- Reduced cognitive load (one file to check)
- Clear Current Focus + Next Actions
- Decision Log with timestamps and rationale
- Faster context loading for AI agents

## Historical Value

These files contain valuable historical context about:
- Phase 1 & 2 completion details
- Original 7-phase plan
- Detailed progress metrics
- Early technical decisions and learnings

**Reference these files** when you need historical context about earlier phases or detailed progress tracking.
